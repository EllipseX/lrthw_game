# lrthw_game
exercise 36 for lrthw

Be sure to install Ruby 2.3.3 or higher before trying to run.
I don't know how to build an installer, after all.

To play:

1: install ruby with provided installer or dl from the webnets.
	links: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ 
2: open powershell
	--type in ruby -v
	--ruby version should be 2.3.3, if not, it may be malware, don't open it.
3: type in: 
	-- ruby ex36_game.rb
4: enjoy...hopefully.

Known bugs:
	X --occasionally will end game abruptly when exiting inn or shop then leaving the city
		--does not occur if one does not enter the shop or inn (both are not relevant anyway)
		
13/1/2017 -- Game crash has been fixed, but game can only be quit from camp for the time being.
